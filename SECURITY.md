## Reporting a Vulnerability

We/Authors take security seriously. If a vulnerability is discovered, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please send a detailed report via **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnraivenolazo/)** or open a "Draft Security Advisory" on GitHub if you have the permissions.

### Response Time
Reports will be acknowledged within 48–72 hours. A fix will be prioritized based on the severity and impact on biometric privacy.

## Biometric Privacy
Suri is designed with "Privacy by Default." If you find a way to extract raw face images or unencrypted embeddings from the local database or the sync stream, this is considered a **High Severity** issue.
