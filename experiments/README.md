# SURI Experiments

This directory contains the experimental work, model training, and validation for SURI's face recognition system.

## Structure

- **[Detection](detection/README.md)** - Face detection model training, datasets, and evaluation
- **[Recognition](recognition/README.md)** - Face recognition model integration and conversion pipeline

## Models

Current model files are located in:
- `detection/models/` - Face detection weights and ONNX files
- `recognition/models/` - Face recognition weights and ONNX files
- `detection/runs/` - Training run outputs and metrics
- `detection/validate/` - Validation results and comparisons

## Quick Links

- [Detection Training Logs](detection/README.md)
- [Recognition Model Integration](recognition/README.md)
- [Performance Metrics](detection/validate/)
- [Model Weights](detection/models/)

Each subdirectory contains detailed documentation for its specific area.
